# About VisionEval Repositories:

The VisionEval.org domain and the VisionEval organzation at GitHub.com are
products of a [Pooled Fund project](http://pooledfund.org/Details/Study/621)
(the "Pooled Fund") that is led by the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) with support
from seven states and three Metropolitan Planning Organizations.

Updates to the code, documentation and other VisionEval resources sponsored by
the pooled fund are delivered through two repositories in the VisionEval
organization:

* [VisionEval](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval) - the released versions of VisionEval (all releases are tagged)
* [VisionEval-Dev](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Dev) - (this repository) development version of VisionEval.

# Branches in VisionEval-Dev (this repository)

The `master` branch in VisionEval-Dev contains public releases of VisionEval
code, documentation and other resources.  It is identical to the `master` branch
in VisionEval.

The `development` branch in VisionEval-Dev is work destined to become the next
release of VisionEval.  While this branch will be complete and operable, and may
have new features compared to the public version, it will change often and will
sometimes be broken.  New developments appear on this branch, and when all is
well, `development` is pushed to `master` and tagged as the next release.  These
developments are managed by the Pooled Fund.

The `readme-dev` branch of VisionEval-Dev (containing this document) includes
documentation of the various public VisionEval repositories.

Additional branches may appear in this repository, typically consisting of
development branches offered as possible updates by organizations unaffiliated
with the Pooled Fund.  These are maintained for reference, and will eventually
be merged into `development`.

Using any VisionEval code other than the `master` branch (which may be pulled either from VisionEval or from VisionEval-Dev) happens at your own risk.

New outside contributions to VisionEval should be based either on a tagged release in `master` (preferred) or on `development` (it is the submitter's responsibility to ensure that their submission remains current as `development` changes).

# VisionEval is an Open Source project

Pooled Fund development activities are being conducted under contracts with FHWA. Pursuant to project management requirements related to the integrity of the work performed for hire under this contract, the Lead Agency will only publish materials that have been reviewed and accepted.

Once published, all VisionEval materials (code, documentation, executables) are released under an unrestricted license, allowing anyone to use, copy, or modify the materials without limitation.  Those materials include everything available in the VisionEval and VisionEval-Dev repositories.
