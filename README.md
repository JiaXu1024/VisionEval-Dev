# VisionEval

**IMPORTANT**: the `development` branch is no more! Yes, it looks like it is still here,
but that is an **illusion**. This branch (aside from this one commit changing the
README.md file) is identical to `master` at the `public-2.0` branch.

All new development should be based on the `development-next` branch.

Thanks for your cooperation. If you have questions or complaints, please contact
